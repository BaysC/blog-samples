    "Python is a very popular language amongst data scientists due to the extensive list of libraries available to us. Pandas and Numpy inparticular are extremely useful at supporting data scientists to solve machine learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python also comes with it's own set of disadvantages. As Python is an interpreted language (code is executed line-by-line) it is significantly slower than it's counterlanguages; C and Java for example. With the rise of big data, more data is becoming available for data scientists to work with. Meaning it is important to find ways of keeping the code as efficient as possible and not carrying out any unneccessay computation time. One way of doing this is by avoiding for-loops. By making use of the inbuilt optimised routines, forcing all operations to be carried out in parallel can assist us in writing highly efficient code. Not only does this signficantly reduce the computation time, it in-turn reduces the amount of code. This making the code faster and much easier to check for bugs. Throughout this blog we will see different examples of python code which will execute the same task, but with considerably different run times.\n"
