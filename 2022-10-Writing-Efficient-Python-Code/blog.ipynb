    "Python is a very popular language amongst data scientists due to the extensive list of libraries available to us. The libraries `pandas` and `numpy` in particular are extremely useful when solving data science and machine learning problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python also comes with some disadvantages. As Python is an interpreted language (code is executed line-by-line) it is significantly slower than other languages; C and Java for example. With the rise of big data, more data is becoming available for data scientists to work with. This means it is important to find ways of keeping code as efficient as possible, thereby avoiding any unnecessary computation time. One way of doing this is by making use of the in-built optimised routines in `pandas` and `numpy`.\n",

This might seem minor here, as we are considering computation times of less than a second, but when working with considerably more data, this change can go a long way. It is also worth noting that the code for the vectorized version is much closer to the plain mathematical statement of the problem.\n",
