    "# Back it up, Back it in, let me begin - Automated backup of Microsoft SharePoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the modern age of cloud computing, where companies routinely synchronise their data to cloud storage facilities, backups are important. Anyone who has been (un)fortunate enough to be involved with ISO27001 knows there are plenty of questions in it about backups, and the answer 'we're assuming AWS doesn't ever break or go out of business, and that none of our employees do anything silly' results in tooth-sucking from auditors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cloud providers offer their own backup offerings, providing redundancy for any data you have stored on their systems, but those of you who want to don the tin-foil-hat of a paranoid risk owner may wish to have another option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud provders often offer migration services - how to get your on-premises or differently stored data ON to their systems, but don't so frequently offer systems to get it OFF as easily, and this can mean you are left with some repetitive clicking to do a monthly backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, computers were designed to do repetitive tasks to take the pain away from humans... so here is how we can use them to do an otherwise tedious backup to a local disk from Microsoft SharePoint.\n",

    "### Taking an automated Offline Backup of Multiple SharePoint Sites\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog focuses on how to use PowerShell to do an automated backup of multiple SharePoint sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backing up one SharePoint site is pretty simple, but if your organisation uses multiple sites to restrict access to project and shared files to those who need to know, following the principle of Least Privileges, then here is a way to overcome the repetitive task of logging into each site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the steps in this blog, you will need to have 'SharePoint Administrtor' rights available to you.\n",
    "You will also need to have PowerShell 7 installed - not the same as 'Windows Powershell' you will find in Windows, which is actually version 5.1."
