# Work Smart Not Hard - An Introduction to Machine Learning

With the rise in demand for machine learning (ML) over the last few years, comes the need for quality resources. 
As data science and ML are becoming more and more popular, so is the importance of online communities. 
Sharing knowledge, expertise and code amongst each other, can help experts keep up with the latest advances in the field. 
Collaboration is crucial within the data science world, and is done so through resources such as blogs, articles and webinars. 
This opens the door for opportunities such as; discussing best practices, receiving feedback and learning from other experts.

At Bays Consulting, we have recently started to explore sharing our knowledge and expertise through a series of webinars. 
ML can add great value to companies and many sectors are now implementing it to solve complex business problems.
They are able to generate actionable insights, assisting with their decision-making, helping them stay ahead of the curve. 
However, it is important to remember that ML is not the answer to every problem, and is _only as good as the data it is given_ (Garbage in, Garbage out!). 
When used incorrectly, it can often cause more harm than good. 

ML can be overwhelming to people who are not directly working with it, so the webinar (and this blog) attempts to bring it back to basics.

ML can have a huge impact on helping businesses identify opportunities such as improving their business efficiency and their markerting reach.
There are two very common types of ML; __Supervised Learning__ and __Unsupervised Learning__ which work on different types of data and solve different types of challenges.
__Supervised learning__ is used when you want to build a model that can predict the value of a dependent variable from input variables whereas __unsupervised learning__ is used if you want to find hidden patterns by splitting data into clusters.

For example, supervised ML can be used to predict whether a customer is going to leave a service or stop buying a particular product. 
If a business is able to predict which customers are likely to leave, it gives the company a chance to reach out to the customer proactively and offer them an incentive to stay.

Essentially, we can use historic data, to teach the model what kind of customers are leaving a service by giving the model a set of inputs e.g.,
- How long a customer has been subscribed to a service
- The amount of engagement the customer has had with the company recently

The model learns this information (and whether that customer has left or not) to make predictions for future customers.

__Unsupervised learning__ is used to uncover hidden patterns with data. 
This type of ML works on data that does not have known outputs. 
A popular technique within unsupervised learning is clustering. 
This is where we split the data into groups based on some pre-defined similarity; each cluster is made up of data points that are similar to each other in some way.
 This is, again, popular within marketing, enabling you to cluster groups, where similar people are grouped together. 
 This can allow companies to tailor their marketing approach depending on the customer group.

There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm to solve every problem and it is often trial-and-error, but there are basic considerations that can help guide your decision.
Some considerations are as follows:
- __Computation time__
    - Do you need a model that has quick training time or prediction time? or both?
- __Explainability and interpretability vs Complexibility__
    - Do you need a model that can be disected and explained easily? Or can you use a more complex model if it increases the accuracy but sacrifice on the interpretability?
- __Scalability__
    - Does your model need to handle large volumes of data?
- __Output__
    - _How_ is the output going to be used? E.g., are they going to be used to assist a stakeholder to make important business decisions? If so, the explainability may be what they are most interested in. Understanding how the results are generated and how the model is working can provide reassurance that the right decisions are being made.


The webinar talks about the above topics in more detail and can be watched 

In addition to the webinar, Bays Consulting are offering training courses. The Machine Learning Primer will give you hands-on experience in both supervised and unsupervised learning. If you are interested in ML but you are not sure where to start - this course is for you! By the end of the course, you will understand the foundations of ML and will be able build and interpret a simple model in Python.
